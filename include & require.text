include_once: Ensures that the specified file is included only once in the script, 
even if called multiple times. It is useful for avoiding duplicate inclusions of files 
that might cause errors (e.g., re-declaring functions or classes).

require_once: Similar to include_once, but it is stricter. If the file is not found, 
it stops the script execution (throws a fatal error). Use it for files critical to the application.

Use include if the file is optional and the script should continue even if the file is missing.
Use require if the file is essential and the script must not proceed without it.
Use include_once or require_once to avoid duplicate loading of critical or optional files.
